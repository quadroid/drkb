Delphi Russian Knowledge Base Explorer
======================================

![DRKB Logo](/kb/img/splash.png)

**Delphi Russian Knowledge Base** was a massive collection of articles covering Delphi language, its IDE, various Windows APIs, algorithms, and other related technologies and fields where Delphi could be applied. The project is long dead and almost all material is in (surprise) Russian (except a handful of articles in English), but it still might be interesting for its historical or nostalgia value, or even useful to someone still dealing with antique Win32 applications.

You can read **DRKB** [online](https://quadroid.github.io/drkb/) here on GitHub. This repository contains only the knowledge base sources (table of contents XML tree and HTML articles themselves), now adapted for online viewing.

The source code for **DRKB Explorer** application, used to comfortably work with the knowledge base (navigation, full-text search, etc.), is gone, but the last version is still fully functional on Windows 10 after more than 10 years, â€“ without a single glitch.

While DRKB is predominantly in Russian, the DRKB Explorer is fully translated into English, so you can [download](https://github.com/quadroid/drkb/releases/tag/1.2.2.5) it together with the entire knowledge base and fool around with it for a bit.
