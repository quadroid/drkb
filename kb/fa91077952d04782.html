<p>I've been doing extensive work with Client/Server Delphi and MS SQL Server as my back-end database. The operational model that I use for my Client/Server is that the client application acts only as local interface, and that all queries and calculations - even temporary files - are performed or created on the server. Now this presents a couple of problems in that garbage cleanup isn't quite as easy as it is when using local tables as temporary files.</p>
<p>For instance, a lot of my programs create temporary files that I either reference later in the program or that I use as temporary storage for outer joins. Once I'm done with them, I need to delete them. With local tables, it's a snap. Just get a list of the tables, and with a little bit of code that uses some Windows API calls, delete them. Not so easy with SQL Server tables. The reason why is that you have to go through the BDE to accomplish the task - something that's not necessarily very intuitive. Luckily, however, it doesn't involve low-level BDE API calls.</p>
<p>Below is a procedure listing that drops tables from any SQL Server database. After the listing I'll discuss particulars...</p>
<p>Parameter Descriptions</p>

<pre name="code" class="delphi">
//var Ses : TSession;         //A valid, open session
//DBName : String;            //Name of the SQL Server DB
//ArTables : array of String; //An array of table names
//StatMsg : TStatusMsg);      //A status message callback
                             //procedure
 
</pre>

<p>TStatusMsg is a procedural type used as a callback procedure</p>
<pre name="code" class="delphi">
type
  TStatusMsg = procedure(Msg: string);
 
procedure DropMSSQLTempTables(var Ses: TSession;
  DBName: string;
  ArTables: array of string;
  StatMsg: TStatusMsg);
var
  N: Integer;
  qry: TQuery;
  lst: TStringList;
begin
  lst := TStringList.Create;
 
  Ses.GetTableNames(DBName, '', False, False, lst);
 
  try
    for N := Low(arTables) to High(arTables) do
      if (lst.IndexOf(ArTables[N]) &gt; 0) then
      begin
        StatMsg('Removing ' + arTables[N] +
          ' from client database');
        qry := TQuery.Create(nil);
        with qry do
        begin
          Active := False;
          SessionName := Ses.SessionName;
          DatabaseName := DBName;
          SQL.Add('DROP TABLE ' + arTables[N]);
          try
            ExecSQL;
          finally
            Free;
            qry := nil;
          end;
        end;
      end;
  finally
    lst.Free;
  end; { try/finally }
end;
</pre>

<p>The pseudo-code for this is pretty easy.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Get a listing of all tables in the SQL Server database passed to the procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Get a table name from the table name array.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If a passed table name happens to be in the list of table retrieved from the database, DROP it.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Repeat 2. and 3. until all table names have been exhausted.</p>
<p>The reason why I do the comparison in step 3 is because if you issue a DROP query against a non-existent table, SQL Server will issue an exception. This methodology avoids that issue entirely.</p>
<p>Below is a detailed description of the parameters.</p>

Ses &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;var TSession &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a session instance variable that you pass by reference into the procedure. Note: It MUST be instantiated prior to use. The procedure does not create an instance. It assumes it already exists. This is especially necessary when using this procedure within a thread. But if you're not creating a multi- threaded application, then you can use the default Session variable. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
DBName &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;String &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Name of the MS SQL Server client database &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<p>ArTables &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Array of String &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is an open array of string that you can pass into the procedure. This means that you can pass any size array and the procedure will handle it. For instance, in the Primary table maker program, I define an array as follows:&nbsp; </p>
<pre name="code" class="delphi">
arPat[0] := 'dbo.Temp0';
arPat[1] := 'dbo.Temp1';
arPat[2] := 'dbo.Temp2';
arPat[3] := 'dbo.Temp3';
arPat[4] := 'dbo.Temp4';
arPat[5] := 'dbo.Temp5';
arPat[6] := 'dbo.PatList';
arPat[7] := 'dbo.PatientList';
arPat[8] := 'dbo.EpiList';
arPat[9] := 'dbo.' + FDisease + 'CrossTbl_' + FQtrYr;
arPat[10] := 'dbo.' + FDisease + 'Primary_' + FQtrYr;
</pre>

 and pass it into the procedure. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<p>StatMsg &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TStatusMsg &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a procedural type of : procedure(Msg : String). You can't use a class method for this procedure; instead, you declare a regular procedure that references a regular procedure. For example, I declare an interface-level procedure called StatMsg that references a thread instance variable and a method as follows:&nbsp; </p>
<pre name="code" class="delphi">
procedure StatMsg(Msg: string); 
begin   
thr.FStatMsg := Msg;   
thr.Synchronize(thr.UpdateStatus); 
end;  
</pre>

The trick here is that "thr" is the instance variable used to instantiate my thread class. The instance variable resides in the main form of my application. This means that it too must be declared as an interface variable. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<p>I'm usually averse to using global variables and procedures. It's against structured programming conventions. However, what this procedure buys me is the ability to place it in a centralized library and utilize it in all my programs.</p>
<p>Before you use this, please make sure you review the table above. You need to declare a type of TStatusMsg prior to declaring the procedure. If you don't, you'll get a compilation error.</p>
